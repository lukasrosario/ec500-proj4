# ec500-proj4

### An application that geolocates the user's device and allows them to upload the current location to a cloud log. Implemented in React Native and uses Firebase Authentication and Firestore.

#### How to run locally
- clone the repo
-  `$ yarn`
- `$ cd ios && pod install`
- `$ yarn ios`

That should be all. Note that I did not implelent Android support, so this will only work on iPhone.
